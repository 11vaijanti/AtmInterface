# AtmInterface
The ATM Interface project is a software application that simulates the functionality of an automated teller machine (ATM). It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for users to perform basic banking operations such as checking account balances, withdrawing cash, depositing money, and transferring funds. The project incorporates secure user authentication and transaction processing, ensuring a safe and seamless experience. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of real-time data handling and provides feedback for successful or failed transactions, making it an excellent tool for learning about banking systems and user interface design.
